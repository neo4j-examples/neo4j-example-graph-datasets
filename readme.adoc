= Collection of Useful Datasets to be Imported and Used with Neo4j

== How to provide a Dataset Example

1. find a dataset that's relevant and interesting and not too huge (around 10M nodes/rels max) so it's feasible to import quickly for a user
2. describe the dataset in a few sentences
3. explain where it originates from and perhaps the original format
3. provide a schema picture for the target graph model
4. provide steps to get the source files and where to put them e.g. into `import` directory (if loading from the original URL is not feasible)
4. explain necessary neo4j config changes (e.g. setting min/max heap to 2G or setting page-cache to 2-4G depdending on the dataset)
5. provide load scripts for load csv. with necessary indexes / constraints created upfront
   - explain any non-obvious transformations or conversions
5. provide 3-5 use-case queries on the imported dataset, add explanations and pictures as needed
6. put all that content into an asciidoc file (formatting help here: )
7. put that file into a directory of this github repository (pull request: https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-example-graph-datasets)
7. have someone review that PR and help you generate a browser guide (for https://guides.neo4j.com/datasets/your-dataset ) and optionally a GraphGist
8. If all is good your dataset can be included in http://neo4j.com/developer/example-data

== How to create a Browser-Guide/GraphGist

You create a Guide by creating a file in http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc] syntax.

This section shows the basics of using AsciiDoc syntax and a few additions for https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-create-neo4j-browser-guide/[custom Browser Guides].

Please write one sentence per line, up to the punctuation mark, that makes it much easier to diff the changes.

=== Define a Cypher query

 [source,cypher]
 ----
 CREATE (n{name:'cypher'})-[r:LIKES]->({name:'icecream'}) return n.name, r
 ----

becomes:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n{name:'cypher'})-[r:LIKES]->({name:'icecream'}) return n.name, r
----

Those queries become clickable areas in a Browser Guide that the user can run.

If they have multi-statement mode enabled in Neo4j browser, you can add multiple statements separated by semicolon `;` at the end of line.
That's especially useful for creating indexes/constraints etc.

=== Basic AsciiDoc formatting

[width="50%",cols="1m,1a"]
